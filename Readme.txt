Hi there.

Although it is a small application I tried to create it using all good practice that I have been working.
Although I didn't use any framework I created my application using Dependency Injection and control inversion as you can see it in line 42.
I also create an exception domain to control any exception and I tried to keep my application as an MVC application. 
The only thing that perhaps I would do differently is, instead of put every method in one only interface I could create several interfaces with only one method, however, as it is a small application and every method refer to the same class, I decided to put all methods at the same interface.

Thank you so much for getting in touch with me and I hope to see you soon.
